# Player Data Quicklinks Extension for Chrome
This project is to show quick links on the new tab and from a special item in Chrome

# Setup
- Copy the js/lists.example.js file and rename to js/lists.js
- Change the links to be more useful links - Note that you can have several rows and custom titles for the areas of links
- If you don't want to use the mergefreeze links then delete that section and ignore the next subheading

# Mergefreeze
To get mergefreeze to work you will need the tokens that correlate to the project in mergefreeze. These are available in last pass. Unfortunately each project has it's own token.
# Installation
- Go to `chrome://extensions` in your browswer.
- In the top right choose `Developer Mode`.
- Click the `Load Unpacked` button
- Navigate to the root folder here
- You should now have this plugin installed.

This extension will also work in Firefox by loading a temporary extension (or packaging and loading from a file).
